# Java Menu Driven App

In this assignment for my Application programming II course the directions state to build a "food vending" application.

## Requirements

1. Application menu display - The menu should provide options for the user to chose. Those options include, displaying avaliable items, adding more money to their balance, purchasing an item, checking their balance total, and exiting the program.
2. Using Scanner - Using the Scanner class utility to take user input for menu selection
3. If/Else statments - Using If, else if, and else logic to properly handle user choices and perform actions
4. Have & Call displayItems, and purchaseItems methods
5. Handling Balances - User can add money to their balance and the balance is checked every time the user attempts to purchase items.
6. Exit condition - Exits the program when user selcts

## Skills

This is helpful in showing competency in the Java language. This is a basic program, that can be done in a myriad of languages. As part of this class it is meant to be done in Java. I have done a similar project in python. [Click here to learn more.](https://github.com/Thommond/Command-line-war)

### Usage

If you would like to download this application, simply clone the repository and use with any IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Then run the program locally in the terminal. I used VScode.
